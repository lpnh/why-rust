# Community

In the previous section, I discussed how my experience with Rust
can be summarized as [Empowerment](./empowerment.md).
This is true, and I still think that it's a
good starting point because it describes the potentials
that are more closely related to Rust's aspects as a programming language.
And by "programming language", I'm also hinting at the idea of a "tool".

After all, it's the programming language aspects that people
first think of and are curious about when reading about one, right?
And a programming language is what Rust is, isn't it?
Well, both questions can be answered with a simple "yes".
But the reasons I'm writing this,
and probably the reasons you're reading it, go far beyond that.

If you'll allow me to indulge once again in my old,
probably foolish, habit of summarizing and speculating,
I would suggest that what lies behind these reasons,
or beneath Rust's shiny surface, is a community, really.
I realize this could be said for many things,
but I think it's particularly true for Rust.

Everything I've said about empowerment, and every aspect I may address here,
exists or holds true, because of Rust's community.
This applies to the Rust programming language itself as well.
So, while the upcoming sections may seem to cover various topics, in
reality, I'm simply using different words, or finding new excuses,
to talk about this [vibrant](images/celebration.jpg) and welcoming community.
