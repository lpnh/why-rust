# Community

In the previous section, I discussed how my experience with Rust
can be summarized by **Empowerment**.
This is true, and I still think that it's a very
good starting point because it's closely related to Rust as a programming
language. Usually, it's the aspects of the programming language that people
think of and are curious about when reading about one. After all, Rust is a
programming language, isn't it?

Well, yes, it is. But the reasons I'm writing this,
and probably why you're reading it, go far beyond that.

If you'll allow me to indulge once again in my old,
probably foolish, habit of summarizing and speculating,
I would suggest that what lies behind these reasons,
or beneath Rust's shiny surface, is a community.
I realize we could say that about almost anything,
but for Rust, I believe this holds especially true.

Everything I've said about empowerment, and every aspect I may address here,
exists or holds true because of Rust's community.
And this applies to the Rust programming language itself as well.

So, while the upcoming sections may seem to cover a variety of topics, in
reality, I'm simply using different words, or finding new excuses,
to talk about this vibrant and welcoming community.
