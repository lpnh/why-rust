# Introduction

Be aware: this is not the most trusted source of information about Rust. This is just my humble attempt to share my enthusiasm about Rust and to help spread the word about it. Nevertheless, I will do my best to keep the information up to date and to provide the most reliable sources I can find. I hope this book will be useful to someone. In the worst case, it will be useful to me, as a reminder of why I chose Rust and why that was the best decision I could have made.

Here you will find a collection of links to articles, blog posts, videos, books, or anything else that I can put my hands on and that I think is worth sharing. I will try to organize the content in a way that makes sense to me. I will also try to keep it as simple as possible. The ecosystem around Rust is growing fast and even if I try to keep up with it, I'm sure I will miss something.

I won't try to explain anything about Rust here. I'm just a little Rustacean and there are many people out there who are much more qualified than me and who have already done a great job. I will just try to collect the best resources I can find and organize them in a way that makes sense to me. I hope it will make sense to you too. We'll see.

Now, if you are still here, I assume you are indeed interested in Rust. So, let's get started.
