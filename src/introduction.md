# Introduction

Welcome, friend! Right from the start,
I want to clarify that I'm not here to convince anyone of anything. 
Nor am I claiming to provide the definitive source on Rust.
My aim is to make it easier for those interested
or curious to find the information they need to get started.
And for those who, like me, appreciate constant reminders of why choosing Rust was the best decision ever.

As a little Rustacean, I won't delve deeply into explaining Rust here,
recognizing that many others, more qualified, have already done so.
My goal is to curate some of these insights and resources
in a clear and meaningful way, hoping it resonates with you as well.

This book is an opportunity for me to share my enthusiasm and help spread the
word. Within these pages, you'll find links to articles, blog posts, videos,
books, and any other relevant materials that have caught my attention and seem
worth sharing.

If you're still reading, I assume you're already on board.
So, let's embark on this journey together.
