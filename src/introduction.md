# Introduction

Hello, friend! Right from the start, I want to clarify that my aim isn't to
convince anyone of anything, but to make it easier for those interested or
curious to find the information they need to get started.
And for those who, like me, appreciate constant reminders of why choosing Rust
was the best decision ever: there's a good chance you'll find something valuable
here.

As a little Rustacean, I won't delve deeply into explaining Rust's arcane
secrets, recognizing that many others, more qualified, have already done so.
My goal is to curate some of these available resources and insights
in a clear and meaningful way, hoping it resonates with you as well.

This [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is an opportunity
for me to share my enthusiasm and help spread the word.
Within these pages, you'll find links to articles, blog posts, videos,
books, and any other relevant materials that have caught my attention and seem
worth sharing.

If you've come this far, I assume you're already on board.
So, let's embark on this journey together.
