# Introduction

Welcome, friend! Right from the start,
it's important to state that I'm not here to convince anyone of anything.
Nor am I claiming to provide the definitive source on Rust.
My aim is to make it easier for those interested
or curious to find the information they need to get started.
And for those who, like me, appreciate constant reminders of why choosing Rust was the best decision ever.

As a little Rustacean, I won't delve deeply into explaining Rust here,
recognizing that many others, more qualified, have already done so.
My goal is to curate some of these insights and resources
in a clear and meaningful way, hoping it resonates with you as well.

Here you may find links to articles, blog posts,
videos, books, and any other relevant material that has caught my attention and
seems worth sharing. Aiming for simplicity and relevance in the fast-growing
ecosystem that is Rust.

This book is my humble attempt to contribute to the Rust community,
sharing my enthusiasm and helping to spread the word.

If you're still reading, I assume you're already on board.
So, let's embark on this journey together.
