# Philosopher's Stone

If there's something that ~Fullmetal Alchemist~ Lavoisier teach us is that
"Nothing comes from nothing, nothing disappears. Everything is transformed". Or
something like that. This means that things will not vanish nor will be created
as if by magic.

In programming people give it the fancy name of "trade-off". Which means
basically the same thing: In life we can't have everything. At least, not at
the same time. This was true back then in Lavoisier teens and this is still
true now. But holy molly, sometimes we have a very low self esteem, what gives us a very
low expectation about what we deserve in life.

Where I come from, the first thing any technical assistant will ask you is if
you already tried to turn it off / on. This is *maneuver* is treated as a
universal knowledge to the point people will prefer lie to the assistant and say
they will try to do it once more than admit they forgot about it and waste a
regretful amount of time trying to tackle the problem in a more reasonable way.

I think the shame here is not about how much time you spent with a useless
solution, nor how you are trying to tackle the problem in a overcomplicated way.
The shame is due to the fact that absolute everyone expects that the first
thing you've tried is turn the dawn thing off, count until 5 and turn on again.
And you know what is the most annoying aspect about it? It works.
This is why it became an universal knowledge. It works every single time.

At a certain point, we as humankind simply start accepting that things could
stop working for no apparent reason. And when this happens the only reasonable
way to solve it is by turning them off and then on again.

"That's just the way things are; for some
obscure reason, they can behave in the most random manner".
Doesn't matter how much knowledge we have acquired in life, or how smart or
how creative we are. When something stops to work unexpectedly or even worse,
when it works but in a really weird and unpredictable way. We more soon than
latter end up just accepting it. No one really cares about it anymore. Or when
one cares, one will rapidly forget about it: there as things more urgent to be
occupied in our modern life.

Well, there were one that was not able to forgot.
