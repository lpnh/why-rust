# Preface

Hello, friend! Right from the start, I want to acknowledge that as a little
Rustacean I won't delve deeply into Rust's arcane secrets. This
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is merely an excuse for me to
share my enthusiasm and some thoughts from my journey so far.

If you've come all the way here, I assume you're already on board. So, let's
sail together! Hopefully, you will find something valuable within these pages.
Even if it's just a small reminder of why choosing Rust was the best decision
ever.
