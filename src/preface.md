# Preface

I have to make it clear right from the start: I don't want to convince anyone to use Rust. I just want to make it easier for those who are already interested or at least curious about it to find the information they need to get started. And for those, like me, who need to be constantly reminded of the reasons why they chose Rust. And why that was the best decision they could have made.

On the other hand, if by any chance, you are someone who is searching for a solution to a problem and you are wondering if Rust could be the right tool for the job, I hope this book will help you make up your mind.
