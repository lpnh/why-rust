# Getting Started

The [learn section](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) on Rust's official website
provides three different resources for getting started with Rust. Each resource 
has its own approach, but they all share the common goal of making the learning
process as smooth and enjoyable as possible.

There's already a well-produced piece of content about this topic [available on
youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hXNd6x9sZs). So I'll just say the
following: Take your time and remember to have fun. Learning is a *lifetime*
endeavor.
