# Why Rust ?

An excuse for me to share my enthusiasm and some thoughts from my journey so far.  
Crafted with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and :hearts:

## Setup

You can install mdBook using cargo:

```
cargo install mdbook
```

The official documentation offers more examples for a [CI/CD
environment](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/continuous-integration.html)


Then simply run `mdbook build --open` to compile and open it on a web browser.

### Catppuccin

Make sure you have `mdbook-catppuccin` installed:

```no_rust
cargo install mdbook-catppuccin
```

To add the Catppuccin themes all you have to do is to run `mdbook-catppuccin
install` on the mdBook's root directory.

Check [catppuccin mdBook repository](https://github.com/catppuccin/mdBook) for
more information.
