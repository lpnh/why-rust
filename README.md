# Why Rust ?

This is my humble contribution to help spread the word about Rust.
Crafted with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and :hearts:

## Setup

You can install mdBook like this:

```no_rust
cargo install mdbook --no-default-features --features search --vers "^0.4" --locked
```

Then simply run `mdbook build --open` to compile and open it on a web browser.

### Catppuccin

Make sure you have `mdbook-catppuccin` installed:

```no_rust
cargo install mdbook-catppuccin
```

To add the Catppuccin themes all you have to do is to run `mdbook-catppuccin install` on the mdBook's root directory.

Check [catppuccin mdBook repository](https://github.com/catppuccin/mdBook) for more information.
